This is a react Tic Tac Toe Project.
I've been working on as part of an MIT extension program.
Running opening the index.html file with live server will run the program for you.
I've modified the version provided by the program.
  1.  Squares deactivate once they've been selected.
  2.  Win are recognized and deactivate all the squares.
  3.  Messages at the bottom say who's turn it is, who's won, or if its a tie.
  4.  I added color into the messages, helping to remind the players what color they are.
  5.  I've added a green border to the winning combination
  6.  I've added a restart button
    I've begun working on a move suggester.
  In the future I'd like
  1.  to set the players name, mark (like x and O), color, other colors with a menubar
  2.  set either player to hard or easy cpu
  3.  have a move suggester
  5.  have effects to celebrate the win
  6.  be able to play on a larger square
